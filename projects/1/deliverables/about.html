<h3>My Story</h2>
  <p>
    I sat down in, “Intro to Social Entrepreneurship” in Boulder in 2012 thinking I would learn how to become the next Mark Zuckerberg. Well, the first assignment of the class was, “What is social entrepreneurship?” and I was way off. We learned about the developing world and BFPs like global poverty, environmental destruction, and humanitarian crises. We learned that many have given up hope, and that these challenges have been deemed impossible to overcome. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that this class would teach me how to 1) identify an opportunity, in this case a social, environmental, and economic challenge, and 2) how to use business as a tool to overcome that challenge. Most importantly, 3) my professor, Francy Milner, inspired a hope that transformed into a burning desire. The class not only taught me how to think like an entrepreneur, it changed how I defined success, with 3 bottom lines and generations-to-come, in mind.

  <h3>My Mantra</h3>
  <p>
    I am a man of god, a man of love, strength, and compassion. The needs of others are my needs. I dream big, unreasonably big. Ever tried? Ever Failed? No matter. Try again. Fail Again. Learn. I am disciplined, don’t cheat yourself. I Focus. I think before I act, I act quickly and I get shit done, the right way because good enough sucks. Everything that happens is a blessing, every day is a miracle, and I love life more every day.
  </p>

  <h3>My Life Goal</h3>
  <p>
    Prove to the world that success should be defined in happiness, and that happiness comes from love: love for people, a love of giving, and a love of knowledge.
